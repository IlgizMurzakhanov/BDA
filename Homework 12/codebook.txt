* Subject: A unique numeric identifier associated with each participant in the
           experiment. These identifiers were assigned full at random after
           all data had been gathered.

* Condition: The numeric index of the condition to which a participant had
             been assigned. In the data set, there are five conditions, listed
             below. In the analysis code, there are also references to
             Condition 0, which is defined as the union of all of the data rows
             from all of the five true conditions.
    * 1 - Absolute Gains
    * 2 - Relative Gains
    * 3 - Standard MEL
    * 4 - Absolute Losses
    * 5 - Relative Losses

* Question: The positional index of the question being answered by a single
            participant. Each participant had 25 different questions randomly
            generated for them.

* G: The absolute difference in monetary value between the larger, later
     option and the smaller, sooner option. In the notation of the paper,
     G = X2 - X1.

* R: The relative difference in monetary value between the larger, later
     option and the smaller, sooner option. In the notation of the paper,
     R = X2 / X1.

* D: The delay between the earlier and later options. In the notation of the
     paper, D = T2 - T1.

* X1: The monetary value associated with the smaller, sooner reward.

* T1: The time of receipt associated with the smaller, sooner reward.

* X2: The monetary value associated with the larger, later reward.

* T2: The time of receipt associated with the larger, later reward.

* LaterOptionChosen: Was the larger, later option chosen? 1 if so; 0 if not.
