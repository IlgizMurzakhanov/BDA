1. EM is a special case of variational Bayes, where the distribution of the parameters is restricted to be a point mass.

2. If the predictors are 100 times smaller then the weights will have to be 100 times bigger. Therefore the posterior will have a variance that is 10,000 times bigger. Since the mass matrix should scale with 1/var you should multiply your mass matrix by 1/10,000.

3. Stochastic variational inference (with copulas) and other recent developments. Also, places where ADVI performs poorly (which Andrew hinted at last time).
